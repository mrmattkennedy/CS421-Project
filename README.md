## CS421 Project Submission
This is Matthew Kennedy's report submission for the CS421 final project. This repository includes the code used to exemplify the learnings from the paper [Composable Memory Transactions by Harris. et al](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1065944.1065952).

### Running code
To run the 3 code files, simply clone this repository and run the below lines of code:
```
cabal build
cabal run chapter3
cabal run chapter4
cabal run chapter6
```

### Final report outline
#### Overview
*Describe the motivation, goals, and broad accomplishments of your project in general terms.*


#### Implementation
*A brief description of the important aspects of your implementation, in terms of (a) the major tasks or capabilities of your code; (b) components of the code; (d) status of the project -- what works well, what works partially, and and what is not implemented at all. You MUST compare these with your original proposed goals in the project proposal.*

#### Tests
*Coming up with appropriate tests is one of the most important part of good software development. Your tests should include unit tests, feature tests, and larger test codes. Give a short description of the tests used, performance results if appropriate (e.g., memory consumption for garbage collection) etc. Be sure to explain how these tests exercise the concept(s) you've implemented.*

#### Listing
*A listing of your code. The code should be documented thoroughly and clearly. You don't need to comment every single line or even every single function. Instead, focus on the central functions and data structures in your implementation, and document them well.*
